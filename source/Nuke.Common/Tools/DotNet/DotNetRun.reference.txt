Name
dotnet-run - Runs source code without any explicit compile or launch commands.
Synopsis
dotnet run [-c|--configuration] [-f|--framework] [-p|--project] [[--] [application arguments]] [-h|--help]
Description
The dotnet run command provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one command. It&#39;s useful for fast iterative development from the command line. The command depends on the dotnet build command to build the code. Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to dotnet run as well. 
Output files are written into the default location, which is bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;target&gt;. For example if you have a netcoreapp1.0 application and you run dotnet run, the output is placed in bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0. Files are overwritten as needed. Temporary files are placed in the obj directory. 
If the project specifies multiple frameworks, executing dotnet run results in an error unless the -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt; option is used to specify the framework.
The dotnet run command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you&#39;re trying to run a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use dotnet without a command. For example, to run myapp.dll, use:
dotnet myapp.dll
For more information on the dotnet driver, see the .NET Core Command Line Tools (CLI) topic.
In order to run the application, the dotnet run command resolves the dependencies of the application that are outside of the shared runtime from the NuGet cache. Because it uses cached dependencies, it&#39;s not recommended to use dotnet run to run applications in production. Instead, create a deployment using the dotnet publish command and deploy the published output. 
Options
--
Delimits arguments to dotnet run from arguments for the application being run. All arguments after this one are passed to the application run. 
-h|--help
Prints out a short help for the command.
-c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;
Configuration to use for building the project. The default value is Debug.
-f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;
Builds and runs the app using the specified framework. The framework must be specified in the project file.
-p|--project &lt;PATH/PROJECT.csproj&gt;
Specifies the path and name of the project file. (See the NOTE.) It defaults to the current directory if not specified.
NoteUse the path and name of the project file with the -p|--project option. A regression in the CLI prevents providing a folder path at this time. For more information and to track this issue, see dotnet run -p, can not start a project (dotnet/cli #5992).

Examples
Run the project in the current directory:
dotnet run 
Run the specified project:
dotnet run --project /projects/proj1/proj1.csproj
Run the project in the current directory (the --help argument in this example is passed to the application, since the -- argument is used):
dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help
